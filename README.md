## :clap: Aknowledgements

- [v86](https://github.com/copy/v86) which is **the** emulator for running x86 operating systems in the browser, without it none of the following projects would be possible
- [crunchydata playground](https://www.crunchydata.com/developers/playground) for leading the way and showing the world that it was possible to run PostgreSQL in the browser
- [browser-shell](https://github.com/humphd/browser-shell) which was already way ahead of its time, especially on the filesystem part
- [browser-linux](https://github.com/Darin755/browser-linux) for showing us how we can make the pieces fit together
